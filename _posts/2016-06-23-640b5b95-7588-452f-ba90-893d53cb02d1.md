I am an artist in many aspects of life, as I have been developing my skills as a filmmaker with big aspirations.

I determined it was time to focus on the craft of acting as it has always been a major part of my dream, so for two years I have been studying with the guidance of Director and Talent, Earl Nanhu, of EVN Studios in Toronto.

Today, I am passionate about embracing quality roles to share my talent for the craft of acting; 'Art of Being' --EVN Studios.

I would love to collaborate with you to bring your role to life.
